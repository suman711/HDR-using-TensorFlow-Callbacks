# Handwritten Digits Recognition using TensorFlow with Callbacks
Recognition of Handwritten Digits images using Convolutional Neural Networks in Python with TensorFlow and also Callbacks is used.

### What is Callbacks?
A callback is an object that can perform actions at various stages of training (e.g. at the start or end of an epoch, before or after a single batch, etc).

You can use callbacks to:

Write TensorBoard logs after every batch of training to monitor your metrics
Periodically save your model to disk
Do early stopping
Get a view on internal states and statistics of a model during training
...and more

### MNIST Dataset:
MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is probably one of the most popular datasets among machine learning and deep learning enthusiasts. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale training images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9 and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes.
